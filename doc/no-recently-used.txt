making a dummy file and setting permissions does not work, even as root.

To disable the list for GTK 3 based applications follow these steps:

rm ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel
If THERE ISN'T a "~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini", then

mkdir -p ~/.config/gtk-3.0
    echo -e "[Settings]\ngtk-recent-files-max-age=0\ngtk-recent-files-limit=0" > ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini
If THERE IS a "~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini", then

echo -e "\ngtk-recent-files-max-age=0\ngtk-recent-files-limit=0" >> ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini
(note the ">>" vs the ">" difference ; ">>" appends to a file while a single ">" completely overwrites it, without backup, if it already exists)

And in either case:

rm ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel
To disable the list for GTK 2 based applications follow this step:

echo gtk-recent-files-max-age=0 >> ~/.gtkrc-2.0
These steps are better than changing permissions on the file as they prevent error messages from being shown when launching GTK based applications that rely on the file.
